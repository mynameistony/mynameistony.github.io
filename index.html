	If you're interested in learning a little bit about Web Development, you might be able to find some help hidden in this page.
	<br>
	Perhaps there's a way to <i>view</i> a <i>page</i>'s <i>source</i> and find out what goes into it.
	<br>With the right click you may be able to find it.

		Congratulations! You just took the first step into becoming a web developer!

		Anyways, you may be wondering what all this is...
	
		All this "code" is what's called HyperText Markup Language, or HTML. This is one of the main languages of the Web

		This is essentially instructions for your browser to render what content, where, and how.

			For example if you read through the stuff above, you will see certain words that appear on my page

			Everything is defined with tags that modify the way it is presented by the browser.

			For example: The <a href=""></a> tag creates a hyperlink:

				<a href="https:/mynameistony.github.io"> Here is my Website! </a>

				This will create a link to my website with the text "Here is my Website!"				

		However, this is just the tip of the iceberg...

			This HTML page is static, meaning I sat here and typed it all out.

			Sounds like a pain in the ass to do for every page, of every site, right?

			And what about the flashy animations and cool stuff of more full featured websites?

			Well HTML is not all that goes into a site...

				To create a dynamic page, with changing content, you must implement a scripting language and maybe other stuff

				The 2 most popular are PHP and Javascript

				-PHP stands for PHP Hypertext Pre-processor (Recursive acronym, lulz)

					Just like it's name implies, this language is used to "pre-process" a page before it gets sent to the browser
					allowing it's content to be changed, based on certain user input.

					PHP code gets ran by the server, so Github doesn't allow you to use it your sites :(

					Note: All PHP code is invisible to the user, only it's output is seen by the client

				-Javascript (NOT JAVA) is a client-side scripting langauge

					Javascript is ran by the client browser

					Github pages can use Javascript :)

					But I don't know it very well so, yeah, I'm not gonna talk about it :(

				These languages are used to generate properly formatted HTML with dynamically filled content to the client.

				Without these, there is not user input or changing content, making a website essentially just a pamphlet

			So this was a quick crash course on how the internet works.

			Obviously this is not a complete guide, but hopefully it's a nice starting point.

			If you want to dive deeper right click on my page, then click Inspect Element.

			This is a neat tool to show you what goes on behind the scenes of a page. Check your browsers site for info on how to use it
			
			Then check out W3 schools tutorials, learn how to set up a LAMP stack, and get on your way to building your own site!

			If you want you can go to https://github.com/mynameistony/mynameistony.github.io to view everything that goes into this site right now.
