	<h2>Intro</h2>
	<p>
	Hello to anyone reading this, I'm not quite sure why you're here. Maybe you clicked the wrong link, maybe you wanted to know a little about me, all that matters is you're here and now you're reading this.
	</p>

	<p>
	Welp, let's get started shall we? As of writing this I am 19 years old, I've lived mostly my whole life in a small in the California mountains, where not much goes on, <b>ever</b>.
	</p>
	I enjoy hiking, cooking, tinkering, and <i>recreational activities</i>.
	<p>

	I had always found technology fascinating, and just wanted to learn how it works, but never really knew where to begin.
	It wasn't until my senior year of high school that I discovered the Arduino and began to learn programming and a little bit more about how computers work.
	The Arduino naturally transitioned me to learning C++ and at about that same time my cousin introduced me to Linux.
	Just like most of you, I had only ever known that there was Mac and Windows. He told me if I serious going into the Computer Science field I should use Linux.
	I remember having him install it on my laptop and watching the scrolling terminal text, and thinking "Oh God, what is happening, how can this be OK?"
	He continued to assure that everything is fine, and that scrolling text is a good thing.
	Once had I was free of Microsofts shackles I found out that computers can be so much more than what we think they are. Microsoft and Apple want to keep the users
	knowledge to a minimum so that users rely on them for tech support and software($$$).
	With Linux you are free to do whatever you want, it is extremely flexible, not to mention secure.
	(I could go on for hours about why everyone should learn/use Linux but I won't get into that now)
	Not long after that I graduated High School and went on to a community college where a took a few Computer Science classes.
	I took 2 classes on C++, which were mostly review, though there were some tricks that I didn't already know.
	I took a second semester Linux sys-admin class with no prior experience, other than what I had taught myself on my own laptop.
	</p>
	<p>
	Much of what I have learned about computers is self taught...on my own I've learned 8 different programming languages with the ones I'm most comfortable at the top:
	</p>
	<p>
	-C/C++<br>
	-Python<br>
	-BASH Scripting<br>
	-PHP<br>
	-HTML (not really programming)<br>
	-CSS (again, not really programming)<br>
	-Javascript<br>
	-Java (sorta, not really)<br>
	</p>

	<p>I'm currently working as cook/dishwasher, while working on my Web Development skills, and trying to come up with the next big thing</p>
