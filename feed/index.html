<div class="post-content">I got another website at <a href="http://tonyrogers.ddns.net">http://tonyrogers.ddns.net</a>, it will be more featured than this.<br> Github doesn't allow server-side execution (namely PHP) so I'm somewhat limited with what I can make this site do.<br> <br> With my other site I have full access to all* programs available on the server (which happens to be a Raspberry Pi)<br> Programs like a youtube downloader, network mapper, fortune generator and mostly anything else installed<br> could be accessed through the site.<br> <br> I will also be posting a tutorial soon on how one can setup a website just like this, for FREE.<br> All you need is a Github account and a Github client, both are free, and a little knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<br> <br></div>
